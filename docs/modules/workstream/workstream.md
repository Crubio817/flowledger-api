# Workstream (Sales) Module

Signal â†’ Candidate â†’ Pursuit lifecycle with SLAs, proposals, analytics, and **integrated memory**.

## ðŸ“– Memory Layer Philosophy

### The Problem: Context Loss in Sales Operations

Traditional CRM systems suffer from **institutional amnesia** - critical knowledge gets buried in notes, lost in email chains, or simply forgotten when team members leave. Sales teams repeatedly ask:

- "What did we learn from the last proposal to this client?"
- "Why did we lose that similar deal six months ago?"
- "What are this contact's communication preferences?"
- "Which decision makers were involved in past discussions?"

### Our Solution: Contextual Memory Architecture

The FlowLedger Memory Layer transforms every sales interaction into **searchable institutional knowledge**. Instead of hoping someone remembers to write a note, the system automatically captures, categorizes, and surfaces relevant context when you need it.

#### Core Memory Principles

**1. Automatic Capture**
```
Every workstream action â†’ Memory atom creation â†’ Contextual intelligence
```
No manual note-taking required. The system learns from actual business activities.

**2. Intelligent Scoring**
```
Decision atoms: 100 points (highest value)
Risk factors: 90 points
Client preferences: 80 points
General notes: 60 points
Status updates: 40 points
```
Important information naturally rises to the top based on business impact.

**3. Time-Aware Relevance**
```
Recent + High Score = Most Relevant
Old + Low Score = Automatically Archived
```
Memory cards show what matters now, not everything that ever happened.

**4. Privacy by Design**
```
Redaction â†’ Immediate removal from all queries
Correction â†’ New version with audit trail
Expiry â†’ Automatic cleanup of time-sensitive data
```
Full governance without compromising operational efficiency.

### Memory in Action: A Day in Sales

**Morning Prep** ðŸ“…
- Memory card shows yesterday's client called preferring morning meetings
- Previous proposal feedback automatically surfaces: "Budget approved but prefers fixed pricing"
- Risk atom highlights: "Decision delayed due to Q4 budget freeze last year"

**Client Call** ðŸ“ž
- System captures: "Client confirmed $75k budget, needs delivery by March"
- Automatically creates preference atom: "Prefers weekly status calls on Fridays"
- Records decision: "Will present proposal to board on September 15th"

**Proposal Submission** ðŸ“„
- Memory shows historical win rate improves 23% when proposals include risk mitigation section
- Client preference atom reminds you: "Always CC the CFO on financial documents"
- System captures submission event with automatic follow-up reminder

**Post-Win Analysis** ðŸŽ‰
- Win decision atom created: "Won due to competitive pricing and faster delivery timeline"
- Success pattern captured for future similar opportunities
- Team knowledge preserved even if salesperson changes roles

### Technical Philosophy: Event-Driven Intelligence

```

**Asynchronous by Design**: Memory processing never slows down core business operations

**Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry without creating duplicates

**Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Complete organizational data separation

**API-First**: Memory capabilities available to all applications and integrations

### The Competitive Advantage

Traditional sales teams operate with **fragmented knowledge**. FlowLedger teams operate with **institutional intelligence** that:

- **Prevents Repeated Mistakes**: Historical context prevents recurring issues
- **Accelerates Onboarding**: New team members have instant access to customer history
- **Improves Win Rates**: Data-driven insights inform better proposal strategies
- **Scales Expertise**: Best practices automatically propagate across the team
- **Maintains Continuity**: Client relationships survive personnel changes

### Memory as Strategic Asset

In the knowledge economy, **organizational memory is competitive advantage**. FlowLedger transforms your sales pipeline from a simple tracking system into a **learning organization** that gets smarter with every interaction.

The Memory Layer doesn't just remember what happened - it helps you understand **why it happened** and **what to do next**.

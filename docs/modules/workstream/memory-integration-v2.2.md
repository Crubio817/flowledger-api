# Memory Module Integration v2.2

## üìñ Memory Layer Philosophy

### From CRM to Institutional Intelligence

Traditional sales systems are **reactive tools** - they store what you tell them. FlowLedger's Memory Layer is a **proactive intelligence system** - it learns from what you do and helps you make better decisions.

#### The Knowledge Gap Problem

Every sales organization faces the same challenge:
- **Critical context lives in people's heads** and walks out the door when they leave
- **Important decisions get buried** in meeting notes and email chains  
- **Lessons learned** from lost deals rarely prevent future mistakes
- **Client preferences** get rediscovered painfully in every new interaction

#### Our Memory Solution

The Memory Layer solves this by treating **every business action as a learning opportunity**:

```
Business Action ‚Üí Contextual Atom ‚Üí Institutional Knowledge ‚Üí Better Decisions
```

**Example Flow:**
1. Sales rep updates pursuit status to "lost" 
2. System captures reason: "Budget cut due to economic uncertainty"
3. Memory atom created with risk scoring
4. Future similar deals automatically surface this risk pattern
5. Team proactively addresses budget concerns earlier in pipeline

#### Why This Matters

**Traditional Approach:**
- Rep loses deal ‚Üí Writes note "lost to budget" ‚Üí Knowledge stays with individual
- New rep takes over account ‚Üí Repeats same mistake
- Organization learns nothing ‚Üí Pattern continues

**Memory Layer Approach:**  
- Rep loses deal ‚Üí System captures decision with context ‚Üí Knowledge becomes organizational asset
- Memory surfaces similar risk patterns ‚Üí Team adapts strategy proactively  
- Organization gets smarter ‚Üí Win rates improve over time

### Core Memory Philosophy

#### 1. **Capture Everything, Surface Smartly**
The system captures all context automatically but uses intelligent scoring to surface what matters most. You never lose important information, but you're never overwhelmed by irrelevant details.

#### 2. **Context Over Data**
Raw data tells you what happened. Memory tells you **why it happened** and **what to do next**. Every atom includes source context, timing, and relevance scoring.

#### 3. **Learning Organization**
Each successful pattern gets reinforced. Each failure becomes institutional wisdom. The organization literally gets smarter with every interaction.

#### 4. **Privacy-First Intelligence**
Full governance capabilities ensure sensitive information can be redacted or corrected without losing the learning value of the interaction patterns.

## Overview

The FlowLedger Memory Module is now **fully integrated** into the Workstream Module, providing comprehensive memory capture and retrieval capabilities across all sales lifecycle entities.

## ‚úÖ Integration Status: **COMPLETE**

### What's Working

#### üß† Memory Capture
- **Candidates**: Automatic memory capture for creation, status changes, and notes
- **Pursuits**: Comprehensive memory tracking for stage changes, submissions, wins/losses
- **Communications**: Thread creation, message sending, decisions, and client preferences
- **Engagements**: Creation, status changes, and milestone achievements
- **Clients**: Profile creation, status changes, and notes

#### üîÑ Event Processing
- Memory events are automatically processed by the outbox worker
- Asynchronous atom creation with deduplication
- Automatic summary rebuilding after atom changes
- Exponential backoff and retry logic for failed processing

#### üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture
- `memory.atom`: Core memory storage with content hashing for deduplication
- `memory.summary`: Cached summaries for fast retrieval
- `memory.view_state`: User view tracking for "since last viewed" features
- `memory.redaction`: Governance and correction capabilities

#### üì° API Endpoints
- `GET /api/memory/card`: Retrieve memory card for any entity
- `POST /api/memory/atoms`: Create memory atoms manually
- `POST /api/memory/redactions`: Redact or correct memory atoms

## Technical Implementation

### Memory Helpers in Action

```typescript
// Automatic memory capture in candidates
await candidateMemory.created(orgId, candidateId, candidateName);
await candidateMemory.statusChanged(orgId, candidateId, 'triaged', 'promoted');

// Pursuit lifecycle memory
await pursuitMemory.created(orgId, pursuitId, candidateId, 'qual');
await pursuitMemory.stageChanged(orgId, pursuitId, 'qual', 'pink');
await pursuitMemory.proposalSubmitted(orgId, pursuitId, 'v1');
await pursuitMemory.won(orgId, pursuitId, 'contract secured');

// Communications memory
await commsMemory.messageSent(orgId, threadId, 'reply', messageBody);
await commsMemory.importantDecision(orgId, threadId, 'Client prefers monthly billing');
```

### Event-Driven Processing

```typescript
// Memory events flow through the work_event table
INSERT INTO app.work_event (org_id, item_type, item_id, event_name, payload_json)
VALUES (1, 'memory', 123, 'memory.atom.created', '{...}');

// Processed by memory worker
await processMemoryEvents(); // Creates atoms and rebuilds summaries
```

### Memory Scoring System

- **Decision atoms**: 100 points (highest priority)
- **Risk atoms**: 90 points
- **Preference atoms**: 80 points
- **Note atoms**: 60 points
- **Status atoms**: 40 points

### Data Retention

- **Preferences**: 365 days
- **Decisions**: 365 days
- **Risks**: 365 days
- **Status**: 30 days
- **Notes**: 90 days

## Integration Points

### Workstream Entities

#### Signals
- Currently using direct activity logging
- **Future**: Memory capture for signal enrichment and deduplication insights

#### Candidates
- ‚úÖ Creation memory atoms
- ‚úÖ Status transition memory
- ‚úÖ Note additions captured
- ‚úÖ Board view context enrichment

#### Pursuits

  "atom_id": 123,
  "action": "redact",
  "reason": "Contains PII that should not be stored"
}

// Correct inaccurate information
POST /api/memory/redactions
{
  "atom_id": 123,
  "action": "correct",
  "reason": "Original content had incorrect client name",
  "correction_content": "Corrected client preference: weekly reporting"
}
```

### Audit Trail

## Observability

### Memory Health Metrics
```sql
-- Unprocessed memory events
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_events
FROM app.work_event 
WHERE event_name LIKE 'memory.%' AND processed_at IS NULL;

-- Memory atom distribution
SELECT entity_type, atom_type, COUNT(*) as atom_count
FROM memory.atom 
WHERE org_id = 1 AND is_redacted = 0
GROUP BY entity_type, atom_type;

-- Summary freshness
SELECT entity_type, 
       AVG(DATEDIFF(minute, last_built_at, SYSUTCDATETIME())) as avg_age_minutes
FROM memory.summary
WHERE org_id = 1
GROUP BY entity_type;
```

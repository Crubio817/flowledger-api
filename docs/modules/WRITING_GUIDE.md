# Documentation Writing Guide

Keep docs consistent, brief, and linked from the docs index.

## Structure

- Create/modify docs under `docs/`.
- Add or update a landing page under `docs/modules/` for each module.
- Link from `docs/README.md` so content is discoverable.

## Style

- Audience-first: declare prerequisite context early.
- One purpose per page; link out rather than duplicate.
- Prefer examples and code pointers over prose.
- Use relative links to files in this repo.

## Maintenance

- When adding a new feature, add a short section to the relevant module page and link to code.
- If a page grows too long, split into focused pages and cross-link.
- Avoid duplicating long sections (link instead).
